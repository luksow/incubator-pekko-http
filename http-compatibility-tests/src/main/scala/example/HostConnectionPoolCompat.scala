    HostConnectionPool

    // This one didn't compile even before (private[http] constructor)
    // new HostConnectionPool(hcp.setup)(null)

    // This line compiles but only by giving null as the PoolGateway parameter which was private before
    // This would crash now
    // HostConnectionPool(hcp.setup)(null)

    // These lines compile but require nulling out the gateway parameter
    // They would crash now.
    // hcp.copy(setup = hcp.setup)(null)
    // hcp.copy()(null)

    // This compiles but crashes now but is unlikely user code
    // val Some(setup) = HostConnectionPool.unapply(hcp)
